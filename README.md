# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Assignments from my Data Structures and Algorithms class, taken during 2019. 
These assignments are mainly projects which implement certain data structures like hashtables or trees, 
or algorithms that follow techniques like dynamic programming, divide and conquer, or greedy algs.
